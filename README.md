# Project Type: Business Analytics and Machine Learning


Business Strategy and Analysis
Business Strategy: Understanding which demographic groups are most likely to make purchases allows companies to optimize their resources by focusing marketing and campaigns on these segments. This targeted approach can lead to higher conversion rates and better return on investment (ROI).

Variables:

User ID: Unique identifier for each user.
Gender: User’s gender (Male/Female).
Age: User’s age in years.
EstimatedSalary: User’s estimated annual salary in local currency.
Purchased: Binary variable indicating whether the user made a purchase (1) or not (0).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Distribution of Variables:

Age: The average age is 37.7 years, with a range from 18 to 60 years. There is a wide spread across the working age range.
EstimatedSalary: The average salary in the dataset is 69,742.50, with a standard deviation of approximately 34,097. Salaries range from 15,000 to 150,000, indicating significant variation in economic conditions among users.
Gender Distribution: The dataset includes both male and female users. Gender is a categorical variable requiring specific analysis to identify differences in other variables based on gender.
Relationships Between Variables:

Correlation Between Age and EstimatedSalary: Scatter plots can be used to investigate any clear relationship between age and salary. Initially, there appears to be no strong correlation between these two variables.
Purchase Decision (Purchased) vs. Other Variables: By examining how Age and EstimatedSalary relate to the purchase decision (Purchased), we can identify whether certain age or income groups are more likely to make a purchase.
Unsupervised Machine Learning:

K-Means Clustering:
Purpose: Perform clustering analysis to identify hidden groups in the data that may correlate with the purchase decision (Purchased).
Cluster Selection: Start with 3-4 clusters to see how users group based on age and EstimatedSalary.
Results: After running K-means clustering, examine if certain clusters show a higher frequency of purchase decisions (Purchased = 1). This can provide insights into demographic groups (based on age and income) that are more likely to make purchases.
Presentation of Results:

Visualization of EDA Results:
Scatter Plots: Visualize the distribution of age and EstimatedSalary in relation to the purchase decision.
Box Plots: Examine how EstimatedSalary and Age vary for those who made a purchase (Purchased = 1) compared to those who did not.
Cluster Analysis Results:
Cluster Visualization: Scatter plots with cluster coloring show how users are grouped. Overlay purchase decisions to see if certain clusters have a higher percentage of purchases.
Data Narrative: This analysis demonstrates how identifying potential customer segments based on demographic and income data can provide valuable insights. Using K-means clustering, we identified groups of users with similar age and EstimatedSalary. Results suggest that some of these groups have a higher likelihood of making purchases, making them attractive targets for marketing efforts.

Key Takeaways:

Segmentation: Identified groups with similar age and EstimatedSalary. One or more of these groups may have a higher likelihood of purchasing, making them ideal targets for marketing.
Business Strategy: Understanding which demographic groups are most inclined to make purchases allows businesses to focus marketing and campaigns on these segments, leading to higher conversion rates and better ROI.
Business Benefit: This type of analysis helps companies better understand their customer base, identify new market opportunities, and improve the precision of their marketing campaigns, ultimately leading to increased sales and customer satisfaction.
